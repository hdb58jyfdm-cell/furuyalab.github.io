# Research

Our lab develops biomarker-driven strategies to enable **early detection, risk stratification, and precision prevention**. We combine mechanistic insight with clinically grounded assay development.

## 1) Precision prevention and early detection
We aim to identify measurable biological signals that precede clinically evident cancer and enable non-invasive detection and surveillance.

**Approach:** curated cohorts, PRoBE-style principles when feasible, and clinically practical assay designs.

## 2) Biomarker panels and assay development
We focus on translation: building assays that are robust, scalable, and compatible with real clinical workflows.

**Examples of translation priorities**
- multiplex protein panels (urine-based)
- reproducible QC frameworks and analytical validation thinking
- bridging discovery platforms → targeted assays

## 3) Spatial and multi-omics biology
We connect tissue-level biology to urine/tissue biomarkers and outcomes.

**Methods (examples)**
- spatial transcriptomics / spatial proteomics
- bulk profiling + targeted validation
- integrative analysis across datasets and models

## 4) Experimental models to support temporal biology
We leverage models to understand how early tumor-associated states evolve over time and how they shape measurable biomarker signals.
