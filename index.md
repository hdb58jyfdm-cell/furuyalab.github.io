# Furuya Lab

**Cancer biomarkers for precision prevention and early detection.**

We are a translational cancer research lab focused on developing clinically practical biomarker strategies to improve early detection, risk stratification, and precision prevention. Our work integrates discovery-to-translation pipelines across human cohorts and experimental models, with emphasis on reproducible assays and biologically grounded interpretation.

**Current affiliation:** Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (transitioning to Houston Methodist in 2026)

## Research focus
- **Biomarker discovery & validation** (urine and tissue)
- **Precision prevention & early detection** of urothelial and other cancers
- **Spatial and multi-omics profiling** to connect tissue biology to non-invasive signals
- **Assay development for clinical translation** (scalable, robust, and reproducible)
