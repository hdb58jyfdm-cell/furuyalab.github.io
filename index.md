# Furuya Lab

**Cancer biomarkers for precision prevention and early detection.**

We are a translational cancer research laboratory focused on developing clinically practical biomarker strategies to improve early detection, risk stratification, and precision prevention. Our work integrates discovery-to-translation pipelines across human cohorts and experimental models, with an emphasis on reproducible assays and biologically grounded interpretation.

**Current affiliation:** Cedars-Sinai Medical Center

## Principal Investigator – Personal Statement

My research program is centered on advancing non-invasive biomarker technologies that enable earlier cancer detection, improved risk stratification, and biologically informed precision prevention. A core motivation of the lab is to bridge mechanistic tissue biology with clinically actionable signals measurable in urine, blood, and other accessible biospecimens.

By integrating multi-omics profiling, spatial biology, and assay development, we aim to build robust, scalable diagnostic tools that are directly translatable to real-world clinical settings. Our work spans discovery, analytical validation, and clinical evaluation, with a strong emphasis on reproducibility, cross-cohort validation, and alignment with unmet clinical needs.
