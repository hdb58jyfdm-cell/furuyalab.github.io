    <p class="lead">
      We develop and validate non-invasive biomarkers and integrative multi-omics strategies to enable earlier detection,
      risk stratification, and precision treatment of cancer—with a major focus on bladder cancer and upper-tract urothelial carcinoma.

  <p class="small" style="margin-top:12px;">
    My lab’s goal is to enable precision cancer prevention and earlier, more accurate detection by translating robust biomarker
    discoveries into clinically scalable assays. We focus on building practical diagnostic tools—grounded in human cohorts and
    validated with rigorous analytical and clinical study design—while using multi-omics and spatial biology to connect tissue-level
    mechanisms to measurable, non-invasive signals in urine and blood.
  </p>

  <p class="small">
    We are especially interested in bridging early tumor-associated biology with deployable diagnostics that can reduce reliance on
    invasive procedures, improve risk stratification, and guide personalized surveillance and treatment.
